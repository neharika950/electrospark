Introduction

Welcome to our smart farming hackathon project, where innovation meets agriculture! Our project leverages the power of IoT and AI technologies to transform traditional farming practices into smart, data-driven solutions. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and crop health in real-time, our system empowers farmers to make informed decisions, optimize resource usage, and maximize crop yield. Join us on this journey to revolutionize agriculture and shape the future of farming!
